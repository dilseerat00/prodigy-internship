# Task 1: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is `world_population_dataset`, containing records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

# Data Visualization of Variable Distribution

This repository provides examples of how to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
   - Handled any issues found to ensure the integrity of the data.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts and stacked charts to visualize the distribution of a selected variable (categorical or continuous) within the dataset.

## Conclusion
This EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. It lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
